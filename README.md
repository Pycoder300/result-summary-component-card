# result-summary-component-card
Here i have created a result summary component using HTML and CSS. The card here has a display of inline block. The card is further divided into two more sections AKA left-side and right-side. The left-side has been given a display of flex whereas the right-side has block as its display property. There are two more flex containers on the right side, which are primary-flex and secondary-flex. Primary-flex holds all the stat bars of different colors. The secondary flex holds primary-flex + button inside it. On the left-side, i have added another flex-container that holds the circle and its text as well as the word 'great' and a paragraph tag. Finally i have added a media query of max-width of 600px which shows the card as a column in smaller screens. I have achieved this by giving the HTML body a display of flex and removing any margin and padding it has. Additionally i have set the width of the card to 100 viewport width as soon as it is viewed on smaller screens. Also, i have added the width of both left-side and right-side component of this card to 100% so that it completely covers the screen horizontally from edge to edge. The most difficult part for me was positioning all the inner components in the card (stat bars, button, texts, etc) to make it look as close to its final form and for this i have used display flex a lot of times.
